# TYPE must be one of the following:
# - feat: A new feature (will appear in CHANGELOG)
# - fix: A bug fix (will appear in CHANGELOG)
# - docs: Documentation only changes
# - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - perf: A code change that improves performance (will appear in CHANGELOG)
# - test: Adding missing tests
# - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
#
# SCOPE could be anything specifying place of the commit change.
# For example $location, $browser, $compile, $rootScope, ngHref, ngClick, ngView, etc...
#
# SUBJECT contains succinct description of the change:
# - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# - do not capitalize first letter
# - no dot (.) at the end
